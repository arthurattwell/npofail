> Failure happens. Big fails, small fails, and often a bunch of miniscule failures leading to a gigantic disaster. And it’s okay.
{:.shout}

If you’re trying to do big things, to make a difference in the world, you’re bound to fail some – if not most – of the time. 

The question is, how we react to these failures. Do we pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and carry on regardless? Because if it’s something important that we’re trying to do, and if we really believe in it, we’ll try again. And fail again. And try again. And maybe even one day succeed. 

In this model of “failing forward”, it’s important to have friends. A network who understands that what you’re trying to achieve is bigger than a few missteps along the way.

Such a network needs a safe environment in which to share these lessons of failure. That is why we are launching South Africa’s first non-profit failure conference, the **#NPOFailConf**. 

No donors. No partners. No interns. No notes or reports or commitments or outputs. Not even tweeting (despite the hashtag). No-one except your peers, sharing your experiences of failure, your hurdles, and your lessons.

## Who is behind #NPOFailConf?

The **#NPOFailConf** idea came about when Michelle Matthews read [this article by Jason Norwood-Young](http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2014-08-29-what-ngos-can-learn-from-start-ups-about-failure/).

*	Jason Norwood-Young is Data Journalism Activist at Code4SA.
*	Michelle Matthews is Content Manager at CSI consultancy, Trialogue.
*	Alex O’Donoghue is a development coordinator at a large Cape Town non-profit.

However, we are not representing our organisations. We are running the **#NPOFailConf** as individuals, volunteering our time and energy to create this space.

We believe that the greater the thing we’re trying to accomplish, the greater the risk of failure. In order to do great things, it’s important to be able to acknowledge failure as part of the process. Failure is inevitable, but by not acknowledging it, we create an environment of lies where no-one can learn from the failures, and an environment of fear where nothing great can ever be achieved. 

The **#NPOFailConf** offers a safe environment among our non-profit peers, where we can talk about our failures, openly, honestly and without judgement.
